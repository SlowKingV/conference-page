# HTML/CSS & JavaScript capstone project - Conference page

> In this capstone project what you are going to build is based on an online website for a conference. We provide some design guidelines for you to create the website, but you must personalize the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course. It's very important the you personalize your project so that you have something unique in your portfolio to share with potential employers during job searching.

- (Used Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint, and ESLint as linters)
